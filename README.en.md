`NTE Ray Tracing Panel` is a local WebUI for the verified Neverness To Everness / Ananta ray tracing unlock workflow. It wraps OptiScaler GPU spoofing with path detection, install, manifest backup, restore, logs, and release-ready documentation.

This is not an online service. The browser page is only the WebUI; the Python process or packaged exe is the local backend that reads/writes files. Closing the browser tab does not stop the backend. Use the "Exit Tool" button in the panel, or end `NTERayTracingPanel.exe` from Task Manager.

## What It Does

Some NTE test builds hide ray tracing options based on a GPU model allowlist. The verified workaround is to make `HTGame.exe` see a higher whitelisted NVIDIA GPU through OptiScaler DXGI / Streamline spoofing.

Default profile:

```ini
TargetProcessName=HTGame.exe
SpoofedGPUName=NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090
SpoofedVendorId=0x10de
SpoofedDeviceId=0x2684
StreamlineSpoofing=true
Dxgi=true
Registry=false
User32=false
```

## Safety Boundary

- No ProcMon, Sysmon, kernel tracing, or driver monitor is used.
- Default mode does not edit the global GPU registry under `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\PCI`.
- Default mode only manages local files inside the game `Win64` directory.
- Every install creates `_nte_rt_backups\<timestamp>\manifest.json`.
- Restore follows the manifest instead of blindly deleting files.

## Quick Use

1. Run `run.bat`, or run the packaged exe.
2. Select the NTE install directory, the `Win64` directory, or `HTGame.exe`.
3. Click "Download / Prepare OptiScaler".
4. Close NTE and the launcher.
5. Click "Backup and Install Ray Tracing Unlock".
6. Launch the game and check the ray tracing options.

## Core Projects and Thanks

- [OptiScaler](https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler): the GPU spoofing payload used by this panel. The panel prepares OptiScaler from its official GitHub Release and installs `OptiScaler.dll` as a local `winmm.dll` proxy under the selected NTE `Win64` directory.
- [DLSSTweaks](https://github.com/emoose/DLSSTweaks): a related graphics injection/wrapper project. This panel does not implement the DLSSTweaks DLSS render-scale workflow; it only backs up possible legacy `dlsstweaks.ini` and `dlsstweaks.log` files so previous experiments are not overwritten silently.

This project is not OptiScaler, not a DLSSTweaks fork, and not an NVIDIA tool. It is a game-specific installer, backup, restore, and explanation WebUI around the verified OptiScaler workflow. See `NOTICE.md`.
